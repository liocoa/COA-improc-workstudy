4/24 Friday
Managed to get intersection finding working (with a little help)
Finally calculated the length of the copepod in the test image
It is 0.7 mm long
I felt triumphant
Printing to a text file and handling more images starts tomorrow

4/22 Wednesday
Met with Dan and showed him the copepod axis
Continued to struggle with finding intersection points of the grid
  (I thought I had it figured out but they're just not plotting correctly and I haven't figured out why)
Developed a concrete goals to achieve before roping in Andrea:
  Get pixels per mm
  get major axis and length
  print image name, ppm, and length to a text file
  Do this for ~10 images
  Print all to the same text file

4/21 Tuesday
I was able to find and draw the major axis of a copepod with a simple bespoke algorithm
Began working on figuring out the size of the grid (not much progress)

4/18 Saturday
Determined that detecting copepods with the hough ellipse function is not feasible
My computer chewed on it for five hours and never returned

4/17 Friday
Grabbed a copepod image to try out my new skillz
Drumroll please...
I DETECTED THE GRIDLINES!!!

4/15 Wednesday
Meeting with Dan working through Hough
Brain died - didn't do anything else

4/14 Tuesday
Reviewed Sobel and Canny
Began learning Hough both through tutorial and other online resources
Really mostly just struggled through understanding Hough implementation
Looked through Hough implementation from solutions - don't yet follow it

4/11 Saturday
Finished up lecture 1 (filtering) and started lecture 2 (feature detection)

4/10 Friday
Got numpy.ma.where working
Wrote a simple greenscreen function to replicate the same behavior
Worked again in lecture 1 (filtering)
Began to wrap my head around what's going on with convolve

4/8 Wednesday
Met with Dan
Researched image masking function, landed on numpy.ma.where but couldn't get it to work

4/7 Tuesday
Continued working through skimage tutorials
Started on lecture 1, though didn't feel ready to move on
Fought with greenscreen function

4/4 Saturday
Continued working through skimage-tutorials
Worked through lecture 0 on color and exposure
Still struggling with some aspects

4/3 Friday
Began working through skimage-tutorials
Worked through lecture 00

4/1 Wednesday
Met with Dan
Downloaded Anaconda distribution of Python

3/31 Tuesday
Worked through GitHub "Hello World" tutorial
Downloaded Git Bash
Found scikit-image tutorial on GitHub

3/30 Monday
Created a GitHub account
